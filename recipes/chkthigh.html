        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The next time you reach for that last pickle in the jar, 
            hang on to the juice. Chicken marinated in pickle juice 
            makes some mighty tender grilled chicken. The pickle 
            flavor does not overpower, but you do need to like dill 
            pickles to enjoy this.

            <li>4 each skinless chicken thighs </li>
            <li>1 ½ cups dill pickle juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freeze-dried dill</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place chicken thighs in a gallon-sized resealable bag. 
                Pour pickle juice over the chicken. Seal bag and 
                refrigerate for 4 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly 
                oil the grate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk olive oil, seasoned salt, paprika, dill, and pepper 
                together. Remove chicken from pickle juice; discard the 
                juice. Brush all sides of the chicken with the seasoned oil.
