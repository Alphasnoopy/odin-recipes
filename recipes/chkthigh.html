        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The next time you reach for that last pickle in the jar, 
            hang on to the juice. Chicken marinated in pickle juice 
            makes some mighty tender grilled chicken. The pickle 
            flavor does not overpower, but you do need to like dill 
            pickles to enjoy this.
