# Odin-Recipes

In this project, I will be creating a simple recipe website using the basic HTML knowledge I've acquired during The Odin Project. It will link to individual recipes that contain a description of the ingredients and of the steps needed to create the dish.

## Once completed, I will have demonstrated my ability to:
..* Set up HTML files
..* Embed images into webpages
..* Link HTML files
..* Create ordered and unordered lists
..* Create paragraphs and headers
