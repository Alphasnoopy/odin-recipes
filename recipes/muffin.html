        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A pumpkin muffin recipe altered to become this delectable 
            sweet potato concoction that is a true muffin, and not a 
            cake! Added bonus: this recipe just happens to be dairy 
            free, a plus for those who are intolerant to dairy.
